# - requirements.txt
# - Pipfile

# Optionally build PDF and ePub
formats:
  - pdf
  - epub

# Read the Docs can install your project as a package with pip if you have a setup.py, setup.cfg, or pyproject.toml file
# In those cases, it will install the project along with the dependencies specified there
# This is useful to improve Sphinx's autodoc extension

# Enable built-in preview on branches and tags
preview:
  enabled: true

# If you have extra dependencies or special build steps, you can use the following
# However, since your project uses Poetry, the dependencies are managed there
# Just make sure the 'docs' extra group is properly defined in your pyproject.toml

# env:
#   PYTHONPATH: .
